# FUEL AND CAR PRICE DATA ANALYIS (PAKISTAN)
This is an exploratory data analysis project using postgresql to determine key metrics and relations between fuel prices and car prices in Pakistan.

## Purpose

The main objective of this study is to learn the aspects of data analytics that can help extract valuable relations between different data sets such as correlation, trends and key indicators. The data visualizations and extractions can help in further being used for price predictions, and generating predictive AI models for the future, to help the public in understanding the best times to buy and sell vehicles, and making decisions on which vehicles are more suitable to buy than others.
